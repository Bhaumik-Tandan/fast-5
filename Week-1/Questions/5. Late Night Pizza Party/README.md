### The Late Night Pizza Party

you order pizza from xomato late at night, and there’s always a flurry to get them before midnight.
There’s a narrow staircase with n steps, and gig worker can carry pizza boxes either one step or two steps at a time depending on how many they’re balancing.

How many different ways can they reach the top of the staircase carrying pizzas, given this step-size rule?

Example scenarios:

If there are 2 steps, they can either go step-by-step (1 + 1) or take a double step (2): 2 ways.

If there are 3 steps, possible sequences include (1 + 1 + 1), (1 + 2), (2 + 1): 3 ways.

Example:

```
Input:
n = 3

Output:
3
```
