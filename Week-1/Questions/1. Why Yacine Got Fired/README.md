### Do you know why Yacine got fired ?

**Read this conversation carefully between Elon and yacine**

**Elon**: Yacine, during last night’s migration to X-database v2, we lost a tweet.

**Yacine**: Lost?

**Elon**: Completely gone. Tweet IDs were perfect 1, 2, 3… up to the last post. Now one’s missing.

**Yacine**: 😬 Might’ve been my “aggressive” SQL query."I’ll recover it.

**Elon**: No, you’re fired. Someone else will do it.

can you do it for Elon ?

Example :

```
Input:
Total tweets: 5
Remaining IDs: [1, 2, 5, 3]

Output:
4
```
