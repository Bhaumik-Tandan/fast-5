### Late Night code review

Sleepy Dev:
Pushed the new branch, added all the feature flags in sequence.

Sama:
Hmm… the sequence looks fine at first to me, but I swear one of these flags showed up earlier in the list.

Sleepy Dev:
You sure? I added them in the exact order.

Sama:
Yeah. Scroll from the start — the _first_ one that makes you say “wait, didn’t I see you already?”… yes that’s the one we care about.

Your Task:
Given the string of feature-flag IDs , figure out the first one that triggers Dev’s “wait…” moment.

Example :

```
Input: abccbd

Output: c
```
