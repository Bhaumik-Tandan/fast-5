### Fooling canteen cashier

Rahul and his friends went to the college canteen.
There are N snacks on the counter, each with a price written on it.

Rahul wants to buy exactly X snacks for the group.
But here’s the twist, the combined price of those snacks must be “funny” enough
(you know… the kind that makes the cashier raise an eyebrow 🤨).

In their group’s slang, a “funny” total means it’s not evenly split between two people.

Example :

```
Input:
N = 4, X = 3
Prices = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output:
YES

Explanation: Choose 1, 2, 4 -> sum = 7
```
